Can't Compile Next.js 15.1.4 with Specific Network Connection,https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template,['padroes_de_projeto'],"# Current Behavior:
When running npm run dev in Next.js 15.1.4, the development server is accessible on the local network by default.
However, if I connected to a specific network interface (e.g., a specific Ethernet/Wi-Fi adapter), the app fails to compile and gets stuck in the loading stage.
(Cannot work using ```npm run dev -- --hostname localhost``` too)

# Expected Behavior:
The developer should be able to run npm run dev in Next.js 15.1.4 without any issues, even when connected to a specific network interface.

Return to previous page How to keep page status,https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/l3cty4,['padroes_de_projeto'],"Current behavior:
1. In the home page, there is a counter and a uniqueId,
2. Click add, the counter will increase
3. Click about at the top, go to the about page and return, the counter has been reset, and the uniqueId is still the same.
4. (home- > about- > home) Click about at the top, and click home. At this time, the data of the first home and the second home are the same.

Expected behavior:
When returning to the previous page, the original page data should be retained (using zustand, the context should be achievable), but how to distinguish the data of the first home and the second home, so that the two pages have their own state

Private enviroments variables not working with react Msal ,None,['padroes_de_projeto'],"This error occurs because the `AZURE_AD_TENANT` environment variable is not being recognized, resulting in the tenant identifier being `undefined`. As a result, the login process fails, and I am unable to authenticate the user.

**Expected Behavior**:
I expect the login process to initiate successfully without any errors when the `loginRedirect()` function is called. Specifically, I expect the following:

1. The `AZURE_AD_TENANT` environment variable should be correctly loaded and accessible, allowing the authority URL to be constructed properly.
2. Upon successful authentication, I should receive a valid authentication response containing user information and access tokens.
3. The console should display the message ""Login successful:"" followed by the authentication response object.","When I attempt to log in using the MSAL library with the provided configuration, I expect the following behavior:

1. **Successful Authentication**:
   - The login process should initiate without errors when the `loginRedirect()` function is called.
   - Upon successful authentication, I should receive a valid authentication response containing user information and access tokens.

2. **User Redirection**:
   - After successful login, the user should be redirected to the specified `redirectUri` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

3. **Access to Protected Resources**:
   - Once authenticated, the user should be able to access protected resources or APIs that require authentication, using the access token received during the login process.

4. **No Errors**:
   - I expect that no errors will occur during the login process, particularly the error `AADSTS900023: Specified tenant identifier 'undefined' is neither a valid DNS name, nor a valid external domain.` should not be displayed.

Issues with Handling File Inputs and Image Previews in Next.js 15 Form Actions,https://github.com/Marabii/next-js-issue,['padroes_de_projeto'],"**Description:**  
I'm experiencing challenges when working with file inputs, specifically image uploads, in a Next.js 15 application using form actions. The issues arise when attempting to preview selected images and implement a remove functionality. Below are the detailed problems and a minimal reproducible example.

**Issues Encountered:**

1. **Image Inputs Reset on Submit with Validation Errors:**
   - When the form is submitted, the file input resets, causing the user to reselect images if there are validation errors handled in the server action.
   - Despite the file input resetting, the `selectedImages` state on the client side still holds the previously selected images and displays the previews.
   - This discrepancy leads to confusion as the user sees the previews but is required to re-upload the images.

2. **Inability to Synchronize File Input with Selected Images State:**
   - It's not possible to programmatically set the value of the file input (e.g., `value={selectedImages}`) due to security restrictions.
   - This limitation prevents synchronizing the file input with the `selectedImages` state, especially when users remove images from the preview. The file input remains unchanged, leading to inconsistencies.

**Impact:**  
These issues hinder the user experience by creating confusion between the displayed image previews and the actual state of the file input. Users may find it frustrating to re-upload images after encountering validation errors, and the inability to manage the file input state programmatically limits the functionality of the form.

**Expected Behavior:**

- **On Validation Errors:**
  - The file input should retain the selected files to prevent users from re-uploading them.
  - The image previews should accurately reflect the current state of the file input.

- **Synchronizing File Input with State:**
  - It should be possible to programmatically manage the file input's value to match the `selectedImages` state. I know it's not currently possible due to security reasons, but there has to be a workaround.",_No response_

Regression in v15.1.0: `cookies()` throws in server action,https://github.com/debel27/next-issue_server-action-context,['padroes_de_projeto'],"**Expected behavior**

The server action runs successfully.

**Actual behavior**

The server action throws, leading to a blank page. The thrown error is:

```

```js
// No problem with these dependencies

  ""react-dom"": ""19.0.0-rc-65a56d0e-20241020"",
  ""next"": ""15.0.0""

The problem only occurs when JavaScript is disabled on the client. Could it have something to do with hydration?

How to make nextjs build error log more sense?,any build,['arquitetura_software'],"Is there an option in nextjs to make build logs more understandable?

If build has an error, log shows chunk path, but I like to see exact file path, where error occured and line number. If there is error because of request error I'd like to see exact request url and response error code and message.

Is it possible to make logs with such information?

When you remove the `Component` from `app/test/page.tsx` the CSS does no longer wrongly contain the `.page_test__Mq0km` CSS class.
